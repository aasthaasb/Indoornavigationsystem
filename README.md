# 📌Efficient Indoor Navigation: Extracting Insights, Mapping Routes, and Navigating with Precision Using Data-Driven Algorithms and Graph Analysis
Developing a mapping system that involves navigating through 3D environments. This process introduces complexities in pre-defining paths between rooms. Our approach involves a multi-step process aimed at optimizing indoor navigation using Data-based algorithms for node,edge and path detection using Object removal and bounding box algorithms.

# 📌Three major steps involved in developing the navigating routes are:
1) Converting top-down views to graphs
2) Identifying edges and nodes
3) Accessing semantics for object identification
